## General Information


#### Problem statement :
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

#### Dataset Used: 

Surprise housing Sample dataset is used to build the model.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, several factors have a significant impact on the price of a house. The overall quality of the house, as indicated by the "OverallQual" variable, plays a crucial role. Houses with excellent or very good quality tend to command higher prices. The size of the living area ("GrLivArea") and the presence of desirable features such as central air conditioning ("CentralAir_Y") and a brick face exterior ("Exterior1st_BrkFace") also contribute to higher prices.

The neighborhood in which the house is located also plays a significant role. Neighborhoods like Crawfor, Somerst, and NridgHt are associated with higher property values, likely due to their desirability and attractive features. Other factors such as the condition of the house ("OverallCond_Excellent"), the size of the basement ("TotalBsmtSF"), and the presence of a second floor ("2ndFlrSF") also have positive correlations with house prices.

Considering these insights, it is clear that buyers are willing to pay more for houses with better quality, larger living spaces, desirable features, and located in sought-after neighborhoods.
